## 🧠 About Me

🧠 About Me
I'm an '80s kid who started coding in BASIC back in middle school, but my real interest has always been in data — organizing it, analyzing it, and understanding how things connect. In the 2000s, I worked as an intelligence analyst, where I learned link analysis and developed a deep appreciation for graph-based thinking. That experience led me naturally into graph databases, where I’ve been exploring ideas ever since.

I’ve always been more drawn to databases and data modeling than to programming for its own sake. I like building systems that help make sense of complexity — especially when they involve structured data, clean design, and clear interfaces. Tools like Pydantic, FastAPI, and well-scoped agent frameworks fit that mindset well.

These days, I spend time in the Roo Code community as a regular user and helper, and I like testing out new tools when they intersect with my interests in graphs, typed Python, and modular design.
